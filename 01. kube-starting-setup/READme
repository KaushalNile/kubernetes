We need to create deployment objects.
Deployment Objects are the configurations understood by K8s to create Pods, Worker Nodes, etc.

kubectl help

docker build -t imageName:tag .
docker push kaushlnile/imageName:tag
kubectl create deployment deploymentObjName --image=kaushalnile/imageName:tag
    This will create the Deployment Object and the Associated Pods and Containers inside them
    --image flag will search for image in Docker Hub by default.
    K8s runs on VM on your host. Hence it cannot access the image created locally.

kubectl get deployments
    gets the list of Deployment Objects
kubectl get pods
    gets all pods
