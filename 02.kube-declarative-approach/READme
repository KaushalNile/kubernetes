DECLARATIVE APPROACH

    Just as we used docker-compose to replace the multiple docker command.
    In k8s we have .yaml files with configurations for resources (deployment, services, etc)
    Refer deployment.yaml for creating Deployemnt (More details on keys in kube docs)
    kubectl apply -f=configFile1Name.yaml,configFile2Name.yaml 
        creates resources based on config from file
    kubectl delete -f=configFile1Name.yaml,configFile2Name.yaml
        deleted resources related to configfile
