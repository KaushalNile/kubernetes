Pod Internal Communication :
    2 containers running in same Pod can access each other through 'localhost'

Cluster Internal Communication :
    Container from 1 Pod can communicate with containers from other Pod in 3 ways:
        - Using the IP address of the service
            we can get that by running 'kubectl get services'
        - Using the default environment variable exposed by the service
            name of env is 'serviceName_SERVICE_HOST'
            if serviceName contains dash(-), it'll be replaced with underscore(_), and alphabets all caps.
        - Using the deafult internal DNS provided by that service 
            internal DNS is accessed by 'serviceName.namespace'
        - In this example auth-service is ClusterIP because we don't want to expose it to the outside world.
        - tasks-service and users-service is LoadBalancer because we want to expose it and balance the load if replicas are created
